----------

This is of the most recent projects I have completed.
For now:

1. Simple, straight line computer vision based finder
2. A traffic sign classifier using Lenet
3. A simulated self-driving car in the Udacity simulator
4. A more complex lane curvature calulator using computer vision
5. An object detector for cars in video
